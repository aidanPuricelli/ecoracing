        <p><i>
            "The Formula SAE competitions challenge teams of university
            undergraduate and graduate students to conceive, design, fabricate, 
            develop and compete with small, formula style vehicles. The 
            competition is an engineering education competition that 
            requires performance demonstration of vehicles in a series of events, 
            both off track and on track against the clock. Each competition 
            gives teams the chance to demonstrate their creativity and engineering 
            skills in comparison to teams from other universities around the world."

            <h2>Technical Inspection</h2>
            <p>
                Every year FSAE releases rules that every team must follow. 
                These rules dictate how each car is built, but every team has 
                its own unique design. The car goes through a rigorous technical 
                inspection performed by industry professionals. This is where we
                earn our first nose cone sticker.

            <h2>Static Events & Presentations</h2>
            <p>
                After passing technical inspection, we must earn three 
                more stickers: tilt, noise, and brakes. The car heads 
                to the fuel station and then goes up on the lift. With 
                a driver sitting in the car, it is tilted up to 45 and 
                then 60 degrees. Industry professionals are checking for 
                any leaks from the car and if it is safe for the driver. 
                Noise testing is when judges will check that our car does 
                not exceed 110 db. The car then heads to brake testing. 
                A driver will fully accelerate and then lock all four tires 
                without the car turning off. After receiving all stickers for 
                these events, we get to drive!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our design and business presentations also happen during these 
                static events. Our team leads present their designs of the car 
                to industry professionals and are ranked on a multitude of criteria. 
                We also present our business presentation during this time.

            <h2>Dynamic Events</h2>
            <p>
                This is when the driving begins! Drivers compete in skidpad, 
                autocross, and acceleration events. Each event has two drivers 
                per team, and each driver gets two runs. This day is action-packed 
                and when all the hard work pays off!

            <h1>Day 4</h1>
            <h2>Endurance</h2>
            <p>
                The endurance event takes the entirety of the final day. 
                Two drivers compete on the longest course of the competition. 
                Essentially a larger version of autocross, endurance tests for 
                fuel efficiency as well as how well the car can run. Cooling 
                is often the biggest issue in this event. After endurance, cars 
                are tested for how much fuel they used.
